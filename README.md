# refind-config
this refind configuration is the darkened and modified version of the source i've forked. this repo doesn't exist for others to use as it's highly modified to suit my needs but feel free to take whatever as you please.

in a case where you feel like using my configuration, do not forget to modify the boot menu entries and hidden directories for it to match your system as i directly use the `refind.conf` as my theme config file instead of adding a `theme.conf` as an entry to `refind.conf`.

## modificiations i've done:
- modified directory names.
- removed the options for other icon sizes.
- removed the other font options leaving only the `adobe source code pro, 14px`.
- removed the old background and selection `.png`'s, replaced them with darkened ones.
- removed the `theme.conf`, merged it with my `refind.conf`.
